# ELearnApp

The ELearnApp is an educational platform developed using the Angular framework with standalone components and RxJS. Its primary objective is to create a dynamic educational environment that enhances communication between students and trainers.

The portal leverages AWS API Gateway for backend communication, ensuring smooth interaction with various services. It also uses AWS S3 buckets for storing and serving static images, as well as handling photo uploads. This integration provides a seamless and efficient user experience, enabling the portal to facilitate interactive learning.
